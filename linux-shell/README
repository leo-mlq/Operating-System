#Project 1 - Simple_shell

This is a implementation of a simple shell program. We have implemented cases of this shell program to handle commands as well as characters such as '>', '<', '|' and '&'.
We have tested our shell program by running single commands, commands with arguments, commands with '&' as well as commands containing mutiple pipelines on a CSIL machine and found no issue.

Running guideline:
1. cd into file directory
2. make
3. ./simple_shell(with 'shell' prompt)
or ./simple_shell -n (without any prompt for auto grader)

Control-D to exit the program.
